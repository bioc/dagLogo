#' dagLogo provides differential analysis of grouped/ungrouped amino acids usage
#' between an input set of aligned peptide sequences and a background set of 
#' aligned peptide sequences which can be generated in different ways. Results 
#' of Fisher's exact test and/or Z-test are visualized using a heatmap or DAG Logo.
