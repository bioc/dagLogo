#' @title Visualize significant conserved amino acid sequence pattern in groups
#' based on probability theory
#' @description dagLogo provides differential analysis of grouped/ungrouped amino acid usage
#' between an input set of aligned peptide sequences and a background set of 
#' aligned peptide sequences which can be generated in different ways. Results 
#' of Fisher's exact test and/or Z-test are visualized using a heatmap or DAG Logo.
#' @details 
#'   DAG: Differential Amino acid Group
#'   
#'   There are several differences between dagLogo from iceLogo:
#'   
#'   1. The sequence patterns can be grouped by charge, chemistry, hydrophobicity and etc.
#'   
#'   2. dagLogo accepts different length of aligned amino acid sequences.
#'   
#'   3. Except Random, regional (called restricted in dagLogo) and terminal 
#'   (called anchored) background model, the background sequence could be set to 
#'   other regions of the genes in inputs and complementary set of the proteome.
